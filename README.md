# Nonholonomic-WMR-Control
Nonholonomic WMR control using Matlab
wmr.slx is a matlab simulink simulation to control a Nonholonomic WMR whose source comes from the Jounal article:
J. -W. Li, "Adaptive Tracking and Stabilization of Nonholonomic Mobile Robots With Input Saturation," in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, vol. 67, no. 11, pp. 6173-6179, Nov. 2022, doi: 10.1109/TAC.2021.3129158.

This project is pushing continuously until finishing my postgraduate graduation thesis

It will include several simulation about WMR from different essays or dissertations
My method will also be covered.
